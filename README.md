=============

This repository contains polymer elements for interacting
with [Google Cloud Platform](http://example.com/) services.

See the [component landing page](https://googlewebcomponents.github.io/google-cloud) for more information.

### Naming Conventions
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) encompasses a wide variety of
products and APIs so it's important to establish a clear and
consistent naming scheme for the associated components.
We will following the naming scheme implemented by the
[Google Cloud SDK](https://developers.google.com/cloud/sdk/),
which has established a well defined naming scheme for a
collection of commands and subcommands for requesting GCP
services.

Our approach is to map the service identification part of the
Cloud SDK's command syntax into a hyphen separated element
name, which gives us the following mappings:

| Cloud SDK Syntax   | Polymer Element Name   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| gcloud auth        | google-cloud-auth      |
| gcloud config      | google-cloud-config    |
| App Engine(*)      | google-cloud-appengine |
| BigQuery(*)        | google-cloud-bigquery  |
| gcloud compute     | google-cloud-compute   |
| Cloud Datastore(*) | google-cloud-datastore |
| gcloud dns         | google-cloud-dns       |
| Cloud Storage      | google-cloud-storage   |
| gcloud sql         | google-cloud-sql       |

(*) = command not yet implemented in Cloud SDK.

Within each product (e.g. google-cloud-compute, google-cloud-storage),
there will be a potentially large number of sub-components
(e.g. google-cloud-compute-instance, google-cloud-compute-disk,
google-cloud-storage-bucket, google-cloud-storage-object, etc.).
The taxonomy for each set of sub-components will necessarily
vary by product and is left to the design and implementation
of each product's components. Wherever possible, designers
of new components in this collection should take care to
following the naming contention described here, i.e. to
choose names that model those used by the Cloud SDK and
to try to be consistent with other components in this
collection.

### Current Status of this Element Collection

This component collection is still in a very early state
of development. Initially, it includes functionality for
a small subset of the full suite of components anticipated,
however, the goal is to expand this collection over time
to provide a comprehensive set of declarative web components
for interacting with the full set of Google Cloud Platform
products and services.
